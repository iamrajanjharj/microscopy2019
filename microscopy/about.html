					Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, is an institute with total commitment to quality and excellence in academic pursuits. The institute has been granted the status of Institution of National Importance. It was established as Motilal Nehru Regional Engineering College (MNREC) in the year 1961 as a joint enterprise of Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh. MNREC was transformed into National Institute of Technology fully funded by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Gov. of India. The institute offers B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D., M.C.A, M.B.A. degrees in various disciplines of sciences, engineering, technology and humanities.

				<h2 id="foldscope">About foldscope</h2>
				<p>
					<center><img src="img/foldscope.jpg" style="width: 60%;border:13px solid #333;border-radius: 8px;height: auto;"></center><br>
					Foldscopes are origami microscopes that have the potential to change the way we view life and microorganisms around us. Invented a few years ago by Manu Prakash and Jim Cybulski from Stanford University, these pocket-sized tools are now making their way to biodiverse, yet remote parts of the world. A Foldscopecan be assembled from a punched sheet of cardstock, a spherical glass lens, a light emitting diode and a diffuser panel, along with a watch battery that powers the LED. The Foldscope weighs 8 grams and comes in a kit with multiple lenses that provide magnification from 140X to 2,000X. The kit also includes magnets that can be stuck onto the Foldscope to attach it to a smartphone, allowing the user to take pictures of the magnification. A Foldscope can be assembled in seven minutes. 
 					The magnification power is enough to enable the spotting of organisms such as Leishmania, Escherichia coli and malarial parasites.

					The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India and Prakash Lab at Stanford University, USA signed an agreement a few months ago to bring the Foldscope to India to encourage curiosity in science. Following an understanding between DBT and Prakash Lab, foldscopes have been distributed to several college students and series of workshops held across India to popularize the origami paper microscope

				<h2 id="department">About the Department</h2>
				<p>
					The Department gained shape as an independent administrative 'Department of Biotechnology' on April, 2012. The department comprises of eleven expert faculty members from diverse areas. The faculties have also been able to generate the external funding from various government agencies viz. DST, DBT, UGC, MNRE, ICMR etc. and published papers in National/International journals of repute. In addition, several training programs, national, and international conferences has been  organized successfully. The department has independent state-of-art modular laboratories to perform experiments in microbiology, immunology, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell culture and bioprocess technology.

				<p>
					<center><img src="img/slide/third.jpg" style="width: 70%;border:13px solid #333;border-radius: 8px;height: auto;"></center><br>
					The Conference is to provide up-gradation of knowledge and skills and interactions for Faculty/scientist/Principal Investigators of foldscope project and Research Students/Ph.D. students/JRFs who are interested for Microscopy and foldscope related research. The conference shall also provide a platform for collaboration, twinning, and idea exchange among different scientists working in the similar or different area.
